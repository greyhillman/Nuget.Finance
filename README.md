## Movement-based Accounting

Double-entry accounting tracks both where money goes but also where money comes from.
This is essentially a movement of money from one place to another.
Instead of dealing with debits and credits, we deal with these fundamental movements of money, or quantities of commodities, between accounts, which are named places.

The main package for movement-based accounting is [Finance.Accounting](./Finance.Accounting/README.md).
